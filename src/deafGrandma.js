const deafGrandma = (array) => {

// Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!, unless you shout it (type in all capitals).
// If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.
// When you shout BYE, grandma shouts back OK, BYE! and end the conversation.*
// Your input is an array with a list of strings with all the words/sentences you say in order.
// You can expect there is aways a BYE. Although it is not necessarily the last word in the list.
// Your output is an array with a list of strings and every sentence Pine's grandma replies.
// Words/sentences is always a string.
// Example:

// you = ['hi grandma', 'WHAT', 'bye', 'BYE']

// grandma = ['HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!', 'NO, NOT SINCE 1938!', 'HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!', 'OK, BYE!'
